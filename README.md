# Anki-Deck---Things-3-Keyboard-Shortcuts

Wanted to actually learn the keyboard shortcuts for Things 3 instead of constantly looking them up, so I put together a complete Anki deck with all 102 shortcuts from the official docs.
What's in it:

102 cards covering every shortcut (creating, editing, navigation, dates, markdown styling, etc.)
Front: category + command name
Back: keyboard shortcut + explanation where relevant
Cards are tagged by category so you can study specific groups
Clean light mode design with color-coded categories

Available as .apkg (import directly into Anki) and .csv (if you want to customize or use with other flashcard apps).
